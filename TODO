# Bug fixes
- "Notstarted" header -> "Not started"
- Remove the screen on lock
- [iOS] images are square, put them in a square frame

# Performance Improvements
- Prefetch all images
- Use the AppLoading when loading from AsyncStorage
- Hide the Finished items by default

# Features
- Make a settings / sidebar pullout thing
  - Check with Miles about how the iOS UI should be
  - Allow export & import
  - Page to keep track of notes about wheels at the studio
    - How could this possibly be useful to other users? Can it be a hidden feature?
    - "Configure Your Studio" -> user sets N for a 2xN grid of wheels. Studios are usually 2xN. Ours isn't but can approximate.
  - Inspiration page
  - Feedback / Developer info / donate (servers cost money yo)?
- Add multiple images from library at once
- Don't show the * unless the current state has a comment
- Left bar black stuff is ugly

# Technical / meta
- Use the Expo fork of react-native, if it provides benefits
- [iOS] Publish to iOS store
- [server] Delete images from s3 when the user deletes the image or the pot
- [server] Enforce limits for uploads per user per week and/or global limits in s3

# User Education / UX
- Users don't know how to delete images
- It's ugly

# Rejected ideas
- glaze hospital state - can instead use a bisque note
- post-bisque state - Miles will add it if he wants it
- Handle the fact that the images are square on iOS - leave it to Miles
