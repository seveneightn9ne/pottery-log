# Bug fixes
- Remove the screen on lock
- [iOS] images are square, put them in a square frame

# Performance Improvements
- Prefetch all images
- Use the AppLoading when loading from AsyncStorage
- Hide the Finished items by default

# Features
- Make a settings / sidebar pullout thing
  - Check with Miles about how the iOS UI should be
  - Page to keep track of notes about wheels at the studio
    - How could this possibly be useful to other users? Can it be a hidden feature?
    - "Configure Your Studio" -> user sets N for a 2xN grid of wheels. Studios are usually 2xN. Ours isn't but can approximate.
  - Inspiration page
  - Feedback / Developer info / donate (servers cost money yo)?
- Add multiple images from library at once
- Don't show the * unless the current state has a comment

# Technical / meta

# Rejected ideas
- glaze hospital state - can instead use a bisque note
- post-bisque state - Miles will add it if he wants it
- Handle the fact that the images are square on iOS - leave it to Miles
